# Xenosaga_DS_Project
The most ambitious project I've ever attempted

## This is a passion project of mine:
If you come across this, please keep in mind that I am learning as I go and this read me will be kept as a log of sorts of what I am working on.

I've made some headway as far as changing some things, the formatting is not where I want it to be, but honestly I'm proud of it so far. I decided to remove the files from the repo since it's not that interesting and there are a lot of files. A LOT and it didn't upload some of them because of limitations. I mainly wanted to have everything on the repo so it would be better management and I could work on it easily from different devices. Since that seems to be a bust I'm doing it semi-old school by having it all on a flash drive. 

I finished the first scene of just text.

**So far I have not done much for the project, I unpacked the rom to see the internal files and poked around, the hard part**

**I made a small python program to search though the program so that I can find the script for the game so that I can start looking at it and translating, since there are a lot of files and honestly I don't know what I am doing. I found what some of the first parts of dialogue of the game.  
This is the start and I'm honestly feeling pretty hopeful.**
